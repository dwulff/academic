# About

I am a researcher at the [Center for Cognitive and Decision Science](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/en/faculty/centers/cognitive-and-decision-sciences/) (CDS), University of Basel, Switzerland, and an adjunct researcher at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality) (ARC), Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Germany.

I study the cognitive underpinnings of human memory and decision making using experiments, computational modeling, network analysis, natural language processing, and process tracing.
