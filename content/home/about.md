# About

I am a researcher at the [Center for Cognitive and Decision Science](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/en/faculty/centers/cognitive-and-decision-sciences/) (CDS), University of Basel, Switzerland, and an adjunct researcher at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality) (ARC), Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Germany.

I investigate the cognitive underpinnings of human memory and decision making using a pluralistic methodological approach involving experiments, computational modeling, big data analytics, and process tracing.

I am also the founder of [The R Bootcamp](https://therbootcamp.github.io/), an organization of Swiss-based data scientists offering courses and consulting for academic institutions and businesses.
