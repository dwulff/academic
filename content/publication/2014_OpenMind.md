abstract = "In this chapter, we aim to make a case for the need of a common data sharing policy for psychological science, discuss what such a policy should address, and hope to make some practical suggestions along the way. First, we summarize the reasons for open data and what the advantages could be specifically for psychological science. Next, we will address in more detail what it means for data to be truly open, as well as some concerns about open data. Finally, we discuss how we could move toward a more open minded psychology."
